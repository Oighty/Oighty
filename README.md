👋  I’m Oighty, a developer mostly working on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) based smart contracts and applications. I'm interested in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Gaming use cases on the blockchain.

⚔️ I am part of the Solidity Guild, a collective of web3 developers.

🪙  I built raider.finance, an auto-compounding vault implementation for the Crypto Raiders LP staking contracts.
  
🌱  I'm currently learning by doing deep-dive reviews of popular blockchain protocols and thinking about new innovations that could build on them.

🔨  I'm currently building a generalized bonding solution based on the Olympus V2 Bond Depository contract.
